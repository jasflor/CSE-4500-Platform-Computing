    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Hi, my name is Jasmin and I am a second year student here at CSUSB.
         I am currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science.
        </p>
    <h3>A hobby of mine</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">One of my favorite things to do is read. I just finished my first book of 2024, it was
         Slaughterhous-Five, or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death, by Kurt Vonnegut. The title next on my list is Invincible Compendium Volume 1 by Robert Kirkman and Ryan Ottley. 
         I am currently on page 518 and can't wait to keep reading. It is an engrossing read thus far. &#128525; &#128218;
        </p>
    <h3>One more hobby</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Another one of my hobbies is cooking and baking. The latest meal I made was kung pao chicken, chow mein,
         and shrimp fried rice. I served the plate with steamed broccoli as well, it was delightful. And the latest dessert I made was crème brûlée. I love crème brûlée so much, I make it often. 
         But the last time I made it I could not find my torch so I used a hot spoon to melt the sugar onto the custard and it worked quite well actually. I was pleasantly surprised. &#128523;
